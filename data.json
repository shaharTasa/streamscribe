    "transcript": "the in the coming years artificial intelligence is probably going to change your life and likely the entire world but people have a hard time agreeing on exactly how the following are excerpts from a world economic forum interview where renowned computer sigh science professor and ai expert stuart russell helps separate the sense from the nonsense there's a big difference between asking a human to do something and giving that as the objective to winning ice system when you ask a human fetch a cup of coffee you don't mean it should be their life's mission and nothing else in the universe matters even if they have to kill everybody else in starbucks to get you the coffee before it closes they should do that no that's not what you meet meet all the other things that we care about nation factor into your behavior as well the problem with the way we build ai systems not always give them a fixed objective like the algorithms require us to specify everything in the object if you say a we fix the acidification of the oceans yeah you could have a catalytic reaction that does that extremely efficiently but consumes a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere which would apparently cause us to die fairly slow and unpleasant several hours so how do we avoid this problem you might say okay well just be more careful about specifying the objective right don't forget the atmospheric oxygen and then of course the side effect that the reaction in the ocean poisons all the fish okay well i meant don't kill the fish i then well what about the seaweed okay but don't do anything that's going to cause me to die at all in on it all right and the reason that we don't have to do that with humans is that humans often know that they don't know all the things that we care about if you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee and you happen to be in the hotels your sank in paris where the coffee is at thirteen euros and it's entirely reasonable to come back and say well it's thirteen are you sure you want or i could go next to oregon is a perfectly normal thing for a person to do i us you know i'm going to repaint your house is it ok if i take off the drain pipes then put them back we don't think of this as a terribly sophisticated capability but ai systems don't have it because the way we both have now they have to know the world object if we build systems that know that they don't know what the objective is then they start to exhibit these behaviors like asking permission before getting rid of all the options in all these senses control over the ai system comes from the machines uncertainty about what the true objective is it's when you build machines but believe with certainty that they have ejected that's what you get a sort of psychopathic behavior and i think we see the same thing in humans what happens when general purpose ai hits the real economy how do things change can we adapt this is a very old point amazingly aristotle actually has a passage where he says look if we had fully automated weaving machines plucked from the puck a liar used to use it without any humans then we wouldn't need any work it's that idea which i think it was keynes pulled at technological unemployment in nineteen thirty is very obvious they think yeah of course if the machine does the work then i'm going to be unemployed think about the warehouses companies are currently operating before economists they are off automated the way it works is that an old warehouse but you've got tons of stuff piled up all over the place humans go and rummage around and then bring it back and the dog there's a robot who goes and gets the shelving unit that contains the thing that need but the human has to pick the object pao to abandon the off the shelf is that still too difficult but you know at the same time would you make a robot that is accurate enough to be able to pick much any object there's a very wide variety of objects that you can buy that would at a stroke eliminate three or four million jobs is an interesting story that e m forster wrote where everyone is entirely machine independent the story is really about the fact that if you hand over the management of your civilization to machines you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or to teach the next generation how to understand c will leave actually as a modern version where everyone is enfeebled and tantalized by machine that hasn't been possible up to now we've put a lot of us civilization into books but the books can run it for us and so we always have to teach the next generation if you work it out it's about a trillion person years of teaching and learning an unbroken chain that goes back tens of thousands of generations what happens if that chain breaks and i think that's something you have to understand as a sport the actual date of arrival with general purpose ai you're not going to be able to pinpoint writing just a single day it's also not the case this all or nothing the impact is going to be increasing so with every advance in ai it significantly expands the range of tasks so in that sense i think most experts say by the end of the century we're very very likely to have general purpose ai the median is something around twenty forty five i'm a little more on the conservative side i think the problem is harder than we think i like what john mccarthy he was one of the founders of the day when he was asked this question he said well some way but tween five and five hundred years and we are going to need i think several einsteins to make it happen",
